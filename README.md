# Learn-Kana

![Deployment Status](https://github.com/Eldoprano/learn-kana/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)

Fork of [Eldoprano/learn-kana](https://github.com/Eldoprano/learn-kana) with **dark mode** and load-time optimizations.

A website where you will be shoved Kana characters up to your brain, until you get them all.

## This fork

- **Dark mode** — Light / Dark / System toggle (top-left). Preference is saved locally and applied before first paint (no flash).
- **Smaller download** — Japanese display fonts load from Google Fonts instead of shipping ~40MB of local TTF/OTF files. The first visit is much faster; unused handwritten faces stay on the CDN.
- **Theme tokens** — Colors go through CSS variables so both palettes stay consistent across the menu, practice screen, and stats modal.

Original live demos (upstream):
- [GitHub pages](https://eldoprano.github.io/learn-kana/)
- [Cloudflare pages](https://learn-kana.pages.dev/)

## Ideas to implement
- User can choose which Kana groups to practice on. ✅
- A beginner mode that slowly includes more characters into the mix. ❔
- User progress and settings should be saved locally. ✅ (Maybe online in the future...)
- The practicing page will consist of:
  - A minimalistic page showing the current Kana, or group of Kanas. ✅
  - Users keyboard input will be showed below. Or buttons with possible answers. ✅
  - User score will be showned in a corner. ✅
  - The background color will react according to the speed and correctness of the users answer (timed combos?). ☢️
  - A help window will also be available, showing Kanas with their romanjis, together with similar Kanas. ❔
  - Show Kana progress per character. This can be adjusted. ⚠️
  - Meaning of word should be more readable. ⚠️
  - More words for the first groups (and in general). ⚠️
  - When user decides to stop practicing (Or if a timer was set and finished) the user will be showed statistics:
    - How many Kanas you got. ✅
    - Kanas you have difficulties with (based on incorrect answers and... time?). ⚠️
    - Average response time (ignores large time pauses). ✅
